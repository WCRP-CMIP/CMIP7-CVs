        ## Link Activity to CMIP7
        
        Select activities from WCRP-constants to make available in CMIP7.
        
        Activities are initially defined in the [WCRP-constants repository](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/WCRP-constants). You can view existing activities at https://wcrp-cmip.github.io/WCRP-constants/activity/
        
        **If your activity is not listed below**, you must first [register it in WCRP-constants](https://github.com/WCRP-CMIP/WCRP-constants/issues/new?template=activity.yml) and wait for it to be approved before linking it here.
        
        Once your activity exists in WCRP-constants, use this form to make it available for use in CMIP7.
