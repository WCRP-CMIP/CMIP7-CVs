"1pctCO2-bgc","biogeochemically-coupled version of 1 percent per year increasing CO2 experiment","1pctCO2-bgc is retained from CMIP6.  It is a simulation which branches from piControl with a 1% per year increase in CO2 concentration from pre-industrial levels, with the CO2 “biogeochemically-coupled”. This means that only the model’s carbon cycle components (both land and ocean) respond to the increase in CO2, whereas the model’s radiation code uses a constant, preindustrial concentration of CO2.  The 1pctCO2 DECK simulation is required for comparison. This experiment is designed to isolate carbon-concentration and carbon climate elements of the global carbon feedbacks. It will also enable calibration of climate emulators.  See Jones et al 2016: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/2853/2016/ , especially section 3.2.3  Example of use/analysis is Arora et al. 2020: https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/17/4173/2020/","C4MIP","1","unknown"

"abrupt-127k","abrupt imposure of the orbit and greenhouse gases of 127 ka before present","Conceptually similar to abrupt-4xCO2 DECK experiment, except that orbital forcing (eccentricity, obliquity, length of perihelion) and greenhouse gas concentrations as per PMIP4 lig127k (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2017; also refer to Sime et al. in prep.) are abruptly changed from those of piControl, that also serves as an initial state, to their configuration of 127,000 years ago, with high boreal spring to autumn insolation leading to low sea-ice in the Arctic. AOGCM initialized from a spun-up piControl with constant-in-time forcing of orbital parameters and greenhouse gas concentrations indicative of 127,000 years before present; use of components AER, CHEM, BGC is allowed, yet it must be ensured that relevant greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere stay constant at the specified values throughout the simulation; relevant references: Otto-Bliesner et al.

"amip-m4K","AMIP experiment with uniform 4K SST decrease","The configuration of the `amip-m4K` experiment will be the same as the Fast Track `amip-p4K` experiment, except that the sea surface temperatures are uniformly reduced by 4K rather than increased. This cooling should be applied to sea-ice-free grid boxes only. Sea ice and SSTs in grid boxes containing sea ice should remain the same as in the `amip` DECK experiment. In models which employ a fixed lower threshold near freezing for the SST used in the calculation of the surface fluxes, this should ideally also be reduced by 4K. This will support the investigation of inconsistent responses of clouds to a cooling versus a warming climate in a controlled way through comparison with the `amip-p4K` [(Ringer et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023JD038861). This experiment also complements the `abrupt-0p5xCO2` experiment in that one can identify asymmetries in the warming/cooling response with and without interactions with the ocean.

"esm-flat10-zec","zero-emissions commitment CO2 experiment","esm-flat10-zec is newly introduced for CMIP7 as an emissions-driven idealised experiment to quantify sensitivity of the earth system to CO2 emissions.  It requires fully-coupled AOGCM and BGC models with carbon cycle “emissions-driven”  The esm-flat10-zec experiment branches from year 100 of the esm-flat10 simulation, but with CO2 emissions set to zero for initial (minimum) period of 200 years. Longer runs are useful.  It serves as an emissions-driven experiment to diagnose the Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC), which is the continued warming (or cooling) following a sudden cessation of CO2 emissions.  Used with the partner experiments esm-flat10 and esm-flat10-cdr it forms a vital part of assessment of TCRE, ZEC and reversibility. In particular these experiments make assessment of ZEC easier than CMIP6 because: the experiment is emissions-driven from the outset and does not require a change in configuration at the branch point and the branch point is common across all models.  more details and analysis can be found here: https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2023-2127/ https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-3356/  this experiment is an evolution of the ZECMIP simulations from CMIP6: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/4375/2019/ , https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/17/2987/2020/","C4MIP","1","unknown"

Longer runs - 300 years – are recommended.
