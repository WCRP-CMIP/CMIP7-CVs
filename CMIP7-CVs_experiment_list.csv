1pctCO2,CO2 prescribed to increase at 1% per year,DECK: 1 percent per year CO2 increase 
 Increase CO2 concentration from pre-industrial level at 1% per year until quadrupling,universal:activity/CMIP,0,150
1pctCO2-bgc,biogeochemically-coupled version of 1 percent per year increasing CO2 experiment,1pctCO2-bgc is retained from CMIP6.  It is a simulation which branches from piControl with a 1% per year increase in CO2 concentration from pre-industrial levels, with the CO2 “biogeochemically-coupled”. This means that only the model’s carbon cycle components (both land and ocean) respond to the increase in CO2, whereas the model’s radiation code uses a constant, preindustrial concentration of CO2.  The 1pctCO2 DECK simulation is required for comparison. This experiment is designed to isolate carbon-concentration and carbon climate elements of the global carbon feedbacks. It will also enable calibration of climate emulators.  See Jones et al 2016: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/2853/2016/ , especially section 3.2.3  Example of use/analysis is Arora et al. 2020: https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/17/4173/2020/,universal:activity/C4MIP,1,unknown

amip,Describe amip in one sentence.,DECK: AMIP 
 AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project) experiment with prescribed SSTs and sea ice,universal:activity/CMIP,0,43
amip-m4K,AMIP experiment with uniform 4K SST decrease,The configuration of the `amip-m4K` experiment will be the same as the Fast Track `amip-p4K` experiment, except that the sea surface temperatures are uniformly reduced by 4K rather than increased. This cooling should be applied to sea-ice-free grid boxes only. Sea ice and SSTs in grid boxes containing sea ice should remain the same as in the `amip` DECK experiment. In models which employ a fixed lower threshold near freezing for the SST used in the calculation of the surface fluxes, this should ideally also be reduced by 4K. This will support the investigation of inconsistent responses of clouds to a cooling versus a warming climate in a controlled way through comparison with the `amip-p4K` [(Ringer et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023JD038861). This experiment also complements the `abrupt-0p5xCO2` experiment in that one can identify asymmetries in the warming/cooling response with and without interactions with the ocean.

amip-p4K,AMIP experiment with uniform 4K SST increase,The same as the `amip` DECK experiment, except that SSTs are subject to a uniform warming of 4K.

esm-flat10,10 PgC/yr constant CO2 emissions experiment,esm-flat10 is newly introduced for CMIP7 as an emissions-driven idealised experiment to quantify sensitivity of the earth system to CO2 emissions. It requires fully-coupled AOGCM and BGC models with carbon cycle “emissions-driven”  The esm-flat10 experiment branches from a stable esm-piControl simulation, with a constant annual prescribed anthropogenic flux of carbon of 10PgC/year into the atmosphere, with globally homogenous emissions for initial (minimum) period, 0-150 years. Longer runs - 300 years – are recommended.  It serves as an emissions-driven experiment to diagnose the Transient Climate Response to cumulative Emissions (TCRE), which is the warming from pre-industrial levels observed after the emission of 1000PgC in a transient scenario.  Used with the partner experiments esm-flat10-zec and esm-flat10-cdr it forms a vital part of assessment of TCRE, ZEC and reversibility. In particular these experiments make assessment of ZEC easier than CMIP6 because: the experiment is emissions-driven from the outset and does not require a change in configuration at the branch point and the branch point is common across all models.  more details and analysis can be found here: https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2023-2127/ https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-3356/,universal:activity/C4MIP,1,unknown

Longer runs are useful.

piClim-histaer,historical and future transient effective radiative forcing from aerosols,A simulation with time-varying aerosol emissions following the `historical` and ScenarioMIP `scen7-mc` scenario, and all other atmospheric components at pre-industrial values. Other than aerosols and the fact that this is a time-varying rather than time-slice experiment, model configuration should be identical to the `piClim-control` run in DECK. Simulations are run atmosphere-only, with a 12-month repeating climatology of sea surface temperatures and sea-ice distributions taken from a climatology of at least 30 years of the same model's `piControl` run. Interactive vegetation, if present in the model, should be turned on. Experiment design is similar to CMIP6 `piClim-histaer` experiment with the future scenario changed from `ssp245` to `scen7-mc`. Note that the CMIP6 RFMIP reference publication (Pincus et al. 2016) referred to `piClim-histaerO3` with time-varying aerosols and ozone, but was replaced in favour of `piClim-histaer` (Smith et al. 2021).

spinup-1950,Coupled control spinup-1950,This experiment is designed to provide a multidecadal spinup for coupled model simulations. Its final output will serve as initial conditions for the control-1950, hist-1950, and highres-4xCO2 scenarios. The setup follows the same design as HighResMIP1, typically run for 50 years starting from the initial conditions.  For solar and ozone forcing, we suggest using an 11-year climatology centered on 1950 to average the solar cycle. For greenhouse gases (GHG), concentrations can be set to 1950 values as defined in CMIP. A 10-year mean around 1950 (e.g., 1946–1955 or 1950–1959) is recommended for aerosols and volcanic forcing.
