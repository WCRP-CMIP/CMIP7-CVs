This cooling should be applied to sea-ice-free grid boxes only. Sea ice and SSTs in grid boxes containing sea ice should remain the same as in the `amip` DECK experiment. In models which employ a fixed lower threshold near freezing for the SST used in the calculation of the surface fluxes, this should ideally also be reduced by 4K. This will support the investigation of inconsistent responses of clouds to a cooling versus a warming climate in a controlled way through comparison with the `amip-p4K` [(Ringer et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023JD038861). This experiment also complements the `abrupt-0p5xCO2` experiment in that one can identify asymmetries in the warming/cooling response with and without interactions with the ocean.

Forcing Interpolation: Interpolate daily mean fields (no diurnal cycle) to the model grid.  3.

                "description": "This experiment is designed to provide a multidecadal spinup for coupled model simulations. Its final output will serve as initial conditions for the control-1950, hist-1950, and highres-4xCO2 scenarios. The setup follows the same design as HighResMIP1, typically run for 50 years starting from the initial conditions.  For solar and ozone forcing, we suggest using an 11-year climatology centered on 1950 to average the solar cycle. For greenhouse gases (GHG), concentrations can be set to 1950 values as defined in CMIP. A 10-year mean around 1950 (e.g., 1946\u20131955 or 1950\u20131959) is recommended for aerosols and volcanic forcing.  For further details, please refer to: Roberts et al. (2025). High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project phase 2 (HighResMIP2) towards CMIP7. Geoscientific Model Development, 18, 1307\u20131332.",
