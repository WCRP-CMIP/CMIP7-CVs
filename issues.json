By the end of the simulation the cumulative emissions over 300 years will be exactly zero – the same amount of CO2 has been removed as was added.\n\nUsed with the partner experiments esm-flat10 and esm-flat10-zec it forms a vital part of assessment of TCRE, ZEC and reversibility. In particular these experiments make assessment of ZEC easier than CMIP6 because: the experiment is emissions-driven from the outset and does not require a change in configuration at the branch point and the branch point is common across all models. \n\nmore details and analysis can be found here:\nhttps://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2023-2127/\nhttps://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-3356/ \n\nthis experiment is an evolution of the CDRMIP simulations from CMIP6: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/11/1133/2018/\n\n\n### MIP / Activity ID (registered)\n\nC4MIP\n\n### MIP / Activity ID (unregistered)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Parent Experiment\n\nCustom Parent: specify below\n\n### Custom Parent Experiment\n\nesm-flat10\n\n### Sub-experiment\n\nnone\n\n### Priority Tier\n\n1\n\n### Source type codes for required model components\n\nAGCM, BGC\n\n### Source type codes for additional allowed model components\n\nAER, CHEM, ISM\n\n### Start Date\n\n0001-01-01 \n\n### Branch Date\n\n100 years into esm-flat10\n\n### (Minimum) Number of Years\n\n200\n\n### Issue Type\n\nexperiment\n\n### Issue Kind\n\nnew\n\n  ### Submitter\n  ChrisJones-MOHC","createdAt":"2025-02-28T11:04:10Z","number":22,"state":"OPEN","title":"New Experiment  esm-flat10-cdr","updatedAt":"2025-03-26T19:09:35Z"},{"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTUwODQz","is_bot":false,"login":"ChrisJones-MOHC","name":""},"body":"### Experiment ID\n\n1pctCO2-rad\n\n### Experiment Title\n\nradiatively-coupled version of 1 percent per year increasing CO2 experiment\n\n### Description\n\n1pctCO2-rad is retained from CMIP6.\n\nIt is a simulation which branches from piControl with a 1% per year increase in CO2 concentration from pre-industrial levels, with the CO2 “radiatively-coupled”. This means that only the model’s radiation code responds to the increase in CO2, whereas the model’s carbon cycle components (both land and ocean) use a constant, preindustrial concentration of CO2.\n\nThe 1pctCO2 DECK simulation is required for comparison. This experiment is designed to isolate carbon-concentration and carbon climate elements of the global carbon feedbacks. It will also enable calibration of climate emulators. \n\nSee Jones et al 2016: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/9/2853/2016/ , especially section 3.2.3\nExample of use/analysis is Arora et al. 2020: https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/17/4173/2020/ \n\n\n### MIP / Activity ID (registered)\n\nC4MIP\n\n### MIP / Activity ID (unregistered)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Parent Experiment\n\npiControl\n\n### Custom Parent Experiment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Sub-experiment\n\nnone\n\n### Priority Tier\n\n1\n\n### Source type codes for required model components\n\nAOGCM, BGC\n\n### Source type codes for additional allowed model components\n\nAER, CHEM, ISM\n\n### Start Date\n\n0001-01-01\n\n### Branch Date\n\nsame as 1pctCO2 DECK simulation.\n\n### (Minimum) Number of Years\n\n150\n\n### Issue Type\n\nexperiment\n\n### Issue Kind\n\nnew\n\n  ### Submitter\n  ChrisJones-MOHC","createdAt":"2025-02-28T10:08:16Z","number":19,"state":"OPEN","title":"New Experiment  1pctCO2-rad","updatedAt":"2025-03-27T16:34:56Z"},{"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTM0Mzk=","is_bot":false,"login":"taylor13","name":""},"body":"After reviewing the form gathering information for experiment registration, I think the following revisions are needed:\n\n1.\tIn “add a title” \nReplace “Add/Modify: Experiment: ``<Type experiment name here>``\"\nWith “Add/Modify: Experiment: ``<Type experiment ID here>``”\nReason: we might as well use the experiment ids as unique identifiers.  I don’t think the MIPs will know what to put for a “name”.\n2.\tAt the very beginning (just after “add a title”), provide some initial guidance:  “Before filling out his form, you should review experiment information [here](https://wcrp-cmip.github.io/CMIP6_CVs/docs/CMIP6_experiment_id.html) provided by the MIPs for CMIP6, which is similar to what is requested below.”  \n3.\tFurther guidance is needed before the MIPs will be able to provide what we need under “Description”.  As a MIP leader, I would have trouble knowing how exactly to respond to the request for experiment design details.   If this information is needed, can we replace all the guidance currently provided with: \n“Please provide a brief description of the experiment along the lines of the descriptions recorded in the last column of [this table](https://wcrp-cmip.github.io/CMIP6_CVs/docs/CMIP6_experiment_id.html).  Point out anything that differentiates this experiment from similar CMIP7 experiments and note if it is similar to a particular CMIP6 experiment.   If available, include links to documents describing in more detail the experiment design.”\n4.\tUnder MIP / Activity, replace “Please select a parent from the list below.” with “Please select MIP from the list below”.\n5.\tThe section regarding “parent experiment” will be needlessly confusing to most MIPs.  The table of scenarioMIP experiments should be eliminated or those experiments should be treated just like the other fasttrack experiments and be included in the drop-down list.  Also, the last 2 entries in the current drop-down list should be eliminated (i.e. delete “very low scenario low overshoot” and “very low scenario high overshoot”).  Only experiment ids should be listed.","createdAt":"2025-02-26T18:36:28Z","number":14,"state":"OPEN","title":"Revisions to the registration form for experiments","updatedAt":"2025-03-26T22:55:18Z"},{"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTM0Mzk=","is_bot":false,"login":"taylor13","name":""},"body":"The current version of the experiment CV will need to be reviewed and possibly modified by the CV Task Team before serving in an official capacity.  In particular, the following changes will be contemplated:\n\n1.  Add \"host_collection\" (hostCollectionDD) to each experiment.  (This is needed for ESGF searches and archive management; it will be included in the DRS.)\n2. Remove \"sub_experiment_id\" from each entry.  I think this is not needed in CMIP7 since the start date or \"decadal prediction\" experiments will be recorded in the \"ripf\" variant_id (e.g., \"r1i2010p1f1\")\n3. Add an \"experiment title\" to each experiment.   These should be terse descriptions of the experiments useful in jogging the memory regarding what the experiment_id stands for.  In CMIP6 this was recorded as the \"experiment\" global attribute as given in column 3 of https://wcrp-cmip.github.io/CMIP6_CVs/docs/CMIP6_experiment_id.html.\n4. Replace \"parent_activity\" with \"parent_collection\".  This will identify both the activity and the phase that produced the parent experiment.\n5. Consider using the generic data descriptor names as keys in all CVs, so that it is easier to access CVs in a uniform way across projects and MIP phases.\n6.
