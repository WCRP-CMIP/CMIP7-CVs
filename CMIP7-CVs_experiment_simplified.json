In models which employ a fixed lower threshold near freezing for the SST used in the calculation of the surface fluxes, this should ideally also be reduced by 4K. This will support the investigation of inconsistent responses of clouds to a cooling versus a warming climate in a controlled way through comparison with the `amip-p4K` [(Ringer et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023JD038861).

Longer runs - 300 years – are recommended.  It serves as an emissions-driven experiment to diagnose the Transient Climate Response to cumulative Emissions (TCRE), which is the warming from pre-industrial levels observed after the emission of 1000PgC in a transient scenario.  Used with the partner experiments esm-flat10-zec and esm-flat10-cdr it forms a vital part of assessment of TCRE, ZEC and reversibility. In particular these experiments make assessment of ZEC easier than CMIP6 because: the experiment is emissions-driven from the outset and does not require a change in configuration at the branch point and the branch point is common across all models.  more details and analysis can be found here: https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2023-2127/ https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-3356/"

Greenhouse gases should be prescribed concentrations. Simulations are run atmosphere-only, with a 12-month repeating climatology of sea surface temperatures and sea-ice distributions taken from a climatology of at least 30 years of the same model's `piControl` run. Interactive vegetation, if present in the model, should be turned on. Experiment design is similar to CMIP6 `piClim-histall` experiment (Pincus et al. 2016) with the future scenario changed from `ssp245` to `scen7-mc`.  Pincus, R., Forster, P.

Its final output will serve as initial conditions for the control-1950, hist-1950, and highres-4xCO2 scenarios. The setup follows the same design as HighResMIP1, typically run for 50 years starting from the initial conditions.  For solar and ozone forcing, we suggest using an 11-year climatology centered on 1950 to average the solar cycle. For greenhouse gases (GHG), concentrations can be set to 1950 values as defined in CMIP. A 10-year mean around 1950 (e.g., 1946–1955 or 1950–1959) is recommended for aerosols and volcanic forcing.
