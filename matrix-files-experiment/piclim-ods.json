Required model settings We encourage modelling centres to include as much atmospheric composition capability as possible. But, as a minimum, models should have stratospheric chemistry. And the experimental setup should be consistent with other AerChemMIP2 experiments, particularly piClim-control.   3. Experiment conditions  4. Links to relevant references Fiedler et al. (in prep.) AerChemMIP2 - Unraveling the role of reactive gases, aerosols, and land use for air quality and climate change in CMIP7  5. Similarities to CMIP6 experiments piClim-HC  6.
