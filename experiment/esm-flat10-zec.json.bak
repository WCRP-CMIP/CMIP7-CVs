    "description": "esm-flat10-zec is newly introduced for CMIP7 as an emissions-driven idealised experiment to quantify sensitivity of the earth system to CO2 emissions.  It requires fully-coupled AOGCM and BGC models with carbon cycle “emissions-driven”  The esm-flat10-zec experiment branches from year 100 of the esm-flat10 simulation, but with CO2 emissions set to zero for initial (minimum) period of 200 years. Longer runs are useful.  It serves as an emissions-driven experiment to diagnose the Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC), which is the continued warming (or cooling) following a sudden cessation of CO2 emissions.  Used with the partner experiments esm-flat10 and esm-flat10-cdr it forms a vital part of assessment of TCRE, ZEC and reversibility. In particular these experiments make assessment of ZEC easier than CMIP6 because: the experiment is emissions-driven from the outset and does not require a change in configuration at the branch point and the branch point is common across all models.  more details and analysis can be found here: https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2023-2127/ https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-3356/  this experiment is an evolution of the ZECMIP simulations from CMIP6: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/4375/2019/ , https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/17/2987/2020/",
