    "description": "CMIP6 DCPP (Boer et al., 2016; www.geosci-model-dev.net/9/3751/2016/) experiments B1 (and B2.1, B2.2)--ongoing fully-coupled decadal forecasts initialized from observation-based states. First full forecast year follows start year (e.g., for 2025 initialization, first full forecast year is 2026). This AR7 FastTrack experiment is a real-time extension of CMIP6 DCPP component B, so a pre-requisite is completion of CMIP6 DCPP component A (experiment id: dcppA-hindcast). For participation in AR7, forecasts should be 10 years long with minimum of 10 ensemble members.",
