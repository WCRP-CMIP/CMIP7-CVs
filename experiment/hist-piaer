Required model settings We encourage modelling centres to include as much atmospheric composition capability as possible. As a minimum, models should have prescribed or interactive aerosols. And the experimental setup should be consistent with other historical experiments.  3. Experiment conditions.  4. Links to relevant references Fiedler et al. (in prep.)
