  "description": "1. Detailed experiment configuration An atmosphere only configuration following piClim but with sea-salt emissions scaled by a factor of 2  2. Required model settings We encourage modelling centres to include as much atmospheric composition capability as possible. As a minimum, models should have prescribed or interactive aerosols. And the experimental setup should be consistent with other AerChemMIP2 experiments, particularly piClim-control.   3. Experiment conditions  4. Links to relevant references Fiedler et al. (in prep.)
