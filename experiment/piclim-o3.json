  "description": "1. Detailed experiment configuration An atmosphere only configuration following piClim-control but using present-day (2021) tropospheric ozone precursors  2. Required model settings We encourage modelling centres to include as much atmospheric composition capability as possible. But, as a minimum, models should have tropospheric chemistry and interactive aerosols. And the experimental setup should be consistent with other AerChemMIP2 experiments, particularly piClim-control. For methane, use year-1850 values in the radiation scheme (2021 values in the chemistry scheme).  3. Experiment conditions  4. Links to relevant references Fiedler et al. (in prep.) AerChemMIP2 - Unraveling the role of reactive gases, aerosols, and land use for air quality and climate change in CMIP7  5. Similarities to CMIP6 experiments None  6. Forcing differences from parent experiment Present-day (2021) tropospheric ozone precursors",
