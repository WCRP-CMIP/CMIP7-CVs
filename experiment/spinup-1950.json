    "description": "This experiment is designed to provide a multidecadal spinup for coupled model simulations. Its final output will serve as initial conditions for the control-1950, hist-1950, and highres-4xCO2 scenarios. The setup follows the same design as HighResMIP1, typically run for 50 years starting from the initial conditions.  For solar and ozone forcing, we suggest using an 11-year climatology centered on 1950 to average the solar cycle. For greenhouse gases (GHG), concentrations can be set to 1950 values as defined in CMIP. A 10-year mean around 1950 (e.g., 1946\u20131955 or 1950\u20131959) is recommended for aerosols and volcanic forcing.  For further details, please refer to: Roberts et al. (2025).
