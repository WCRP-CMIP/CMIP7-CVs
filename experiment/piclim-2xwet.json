    "description": "1. Detailed experiment configuration An atmosphere only configuration following piClim-control but with wetland methane emissions scaled by a factor of 2  2. Required model settings We encourage modelling centres to include as much atmospheric composition capability as possible. But, as a minimum, models should have tropospheric chemistry. And the experimental setup should be consistent with other AerChemMIP2 experiments, particularly piClim-control.  3. Experiment conditions  4. Links to relevant references Fiedler et al. (in prep.) AerChemMIP2 - Unraveling the role of reactive gases, aerosols, and land use for air quality and climate change in CMIP7  5. Similarities to CMIP6 experiments Following piClim-2xX experimental setup  6. Forcing differences from parent experiment Doubled wetland methane emissions",
