    "description": "A simulation with time-varying aerosol emissions following the `historical` and ScenarioMIP `scen7-mc` scenario, and all other atmospheric components at pre-industrial values. Other than aerosols and the fact that this is a time-varying rather than time-slice experiment, model configuration should be identical to the `piClim-control` run in DECK. Simulations are run atmosphere-only, with a 12-month repeating climatology of sea surface temperatures and sea-ice distributions taken from a climatology of at least 30 years of the same model's `piControl` run. Interactive vegetation, if present in the model, should be turned on. Experiment design is similar to CMIP6 `piClim-histaer` experiment with the future scenario changed from `ssp245` to `scen7-mc`. Note that the CMIP6 RFMIP reference publication (Pincus et al. 2016) referred to `piClim-histaerO3` with time-varying aerosols and ozone, but was replaced in favour of `piClim-histaer` (Smith et al. 2021).
