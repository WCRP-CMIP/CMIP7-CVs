    "description": "1. Experiment Configuration Conduct an atmosphere-only simulation similar to CMIP AMIP for the period 1980\u20132022 using high-resolution daily forcing  2. Model Settings Initial Conditions: Use ERA5 for atmosphere and land initial conditions on 1 January 1980. Spinup: Treat 1980\u20131981 as land surface spinup. Analyze 1982\u20132022. Forcing Interpolation: Interpolate daily mean fields (no diurnal cycle) to the model grid.  3. Forcing Data Use 0.05\u00b0 ESA CCI SST v3.0 and OSI SAF sea ice concentration instead of the 1/4\u00b0 HadISST.2.2.0 dataset.  4. Key Differences from CMIP6 HighResMIP SST Forcing: Upgraded to 0.05\u00b0 ESA CCI SST. Land Spinup: 2 years recommended; alternative methods allowed if documented.  For details, see: Roberts et al. (2025). High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project phase 2 (HighResMIP2) towards CMIP7. Geoscientific Model Development, 18, 1307\u20131332",
