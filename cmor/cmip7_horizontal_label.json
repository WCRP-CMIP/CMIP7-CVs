        "hm": "Variables calculated as spatial averages across horizontal dimensions, typically representing area-weighted means over geographic regions. Used for regional or global horizontal averaging operations.",

        "hxys": "Variables represented as point measurements at specific geographic sites or stations. Used for observational data, tower measurements, or model output extracted at particular locations rather than gridded data.",
        "hy": "Variables calculated as zonal means, averaged along lines of constant latitude (east-west direction). Removes longitudinal variability to show meridional (north-south) patterns and large-scale circulation features."
