This cooling should be applied to sea-ice-free grid boxes only. Sea ice and SSTs in grid boxes containing sea ice should remain the same as in the `amip` DECK experiment. In models which employ a fixed lower threshold near freezing for the SST used in the calculation of the surface fluxes, this should ideally also be reduced by 4K. This will support the investigation of inconsistent responses of clouds to a cooling versus a warming climate in a controlled way through comparison with the `amip-p4K` [(Ringer et al., 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023JD038861). This experiment also complements the `abrupt-0p5xCO2` experiment in that one can identify asymmetries in the warming/cooling response with and without interactions with the ocean.

                "description": "esm-flat10-zec is newly introduced for CMIP7 as an emissions-driven idealised experiment to quantify sensitivity of the earth system to CO2 emissions.  It requires fully-coupled AOGCM and BGC models with carbon cycle \u201cemissions-driven\u201d  The esm-flat10-zec experiment branches from year 100 of the esm-flat10 simulation, but with CO2 emissions set to zero for initial (minimum) period of 200 years. Longer runs are useful.  It serves as an emissions-driven experiment to diagnose the Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC), which is the continued warming (or cooling) following a sudden cessation of CO2 emissions.  Used with the partner experiments esm-flat10 and esm-flat10-cdr it forms a vital part of assessment of TCRE, ZEC and reversibility. In particular these experiments make assessment of ZEC easier than CMIP6 because: the experiment is emissions-driven from the outset and does not require a change in configuration at the branch point and the branch point is common across all models.  more details and analysis can be found here: https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2023-2127/ https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-3356/  this experiment is an evolution of the ZECMIP simulations from CMIP6: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/4375/2019/ , https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/17/2987/2020/",

Other than aerosols and the fact that this is a time-varying rather than time-slice experiment, model configuration should be identical to the `piClim-control` run in DECK. Simulations are run atmosphere-only, with a 12-month repeating climatology of sea surface temperatures and sea-ice distributions taken from a climatology of at least 30 years of the same model's `piControl` run. Interactive vegetation, if present in the model, should be turned on. Experiment design is similar to CMIP6 `piClim-histaer` experiment with the future scenario changed from `ssp245` to `scen7-mc`. Note that the CMIP6 RFMIP reference publication (Pincus et al. 2016) referred to `piClim-histaerO3` with time-varying aerosols and ozone, but was replaced in favour of `piClim-histaer` (Smith et al. 2021).

                "description": "This experiment is designed to provide a multidecadal spinup for coupled model simulations. Its final output will serve as initial conditions for the control-1950, hist-1950, and highres-4xCO2 scenarios. The setup follows the same design as HighResMIP1, typically run for 50 years starting from the initial conditions.  For solar and ozone forcing, we suggest using an 11-year climatology centered on 1950 to average the solar cycle. For greenhouse gases (GHG), concentrations can be set to 1950 values as defined in CMIP. A 10-year mean around 1950 (e.g., 1946\u20131955 or 1950\u20131959) is recommended for aerosols and volcanic forcing.  For further details, please refer to: Roberts et al. (2025). High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project phase 2 (HighResMIP2) towards CMIP7. Geoscientific Model Development, 18, 1307\u20131332.",
