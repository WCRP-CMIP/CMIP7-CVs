    "description": "1pctCO2-bgc is retained from CMIP6.  It is a simulation which branches from piControl with a 1% per year increase in CO2 concentration from pre-industrial levels, with the CO2 “biogeochemically-coupled”. This means that only the model’s carbon cycle components (both land and ocean) respond to the increase in CO2, whereas the model’s radiation code uses a constant, preindustrial concentration of CO2.  The 1pctCO2 DECK simulation is required for comparison. This experiment is designed to isolate carbon-concentration and carbon climate elements of the global carbon feedbacks. It will also enable calibration of climate emulators.
