It is a simulation which branches from piControl with a 1% per year increase in CO2 concentration from pre-industrial levels, with the CO2 “biogeochemically-coupled”.

It requires fully-coupled AOGCM and BGC models with carbon cycle “emissions-driven”  The esm-flat10 experiment branches from a stable esm-piControl simulation, with a constant annual prescribed anthropogenic flux of carbon of 10PgC/year into the atmosphere, with globally homogenous emissions for initial (minimum) period, 0-150 years. Longer runs - 300 years – are recommended.  It serves as an emissions-driven experiment to diagnose the Transient Climate Response to cumulative Emissions (TCRE), which is the warming from pre-industrial levels observed after the emission of 1000PgC in a transient scenario.  Used with the partner experiments esm-flat10-zec and esm-flat10-cdr it forms a vital part of assessment of TCRE, ZEC and reversibility. In particular these experiments make assessment of ZEC easier than CMIP6 because: the experiment is emissions-driven from the outset and does not require a change in configuration at the branch point
