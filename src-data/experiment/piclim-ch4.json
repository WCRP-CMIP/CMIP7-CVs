  "description": "1. Detailed experiment configuration An atmosphere only configuration following piClim but using present-day (2021) methane emissions (or concentrations)  2. Required model settings We encourage modelling centres to include as much atmospheric composition capability as possible. But, as a minimum, models should have tropospheric chemistry and interactive aerosols. And the experimental setup should be consistent with other AerChemMIP2 experiments, particularly piClim-control. For methane, use year-2021 values in both the radiation scheme and the chemistry scheme.   3. Experiment conditions  4. Links to relevant references Fiedler et al. (in prep.)
