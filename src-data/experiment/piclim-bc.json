    "description": "1. Detailed experiment configuration An atmosphere only configuration following piClim-control but using present-day (2021) black carbon  2. Required model settings We encourage modelling centres to include as much atmospheric composition capability as possible. As a minimum, models should have prescribed or interactive aerosols. And the experimental setup should be consistent with other AerChemMIP2 experiments, particularly piClim-control.  3. Experiment conditions  4. Links to relevant references Fiedler et al. (in prep.) AerChemMIP2 - Unraveling the role of reactive gases, aerosols, and land use for air quality and climate change in CMIP7  5. Similarities to CMIP6 experiments Similar to piClim-BC in CMIP6  6. Forcing differences from parent experiment Present-day (2021) BC emissions",
