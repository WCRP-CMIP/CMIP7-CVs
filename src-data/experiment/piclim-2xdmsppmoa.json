    "description": "1. Detailed experiment configuration An atmosphere only configuration following piClim-control but with emissions of primary marine organic compounds and dimethyl sulphide scaled by a factor of 2  2. Required model settings We encourage modelling centres to include as much atmospheric composition capability as possible. As a minimum, models should have prescribed or interactive aerosols. And the experimental setup should be consistent with other AerChemMIP2 experiments, particularly piClim-control.  3. Experiment conditions  4. Links to relevant references Fiedler et al. (in prep.) AerChemMIP2 - Unraveling the role of reactive gases, aerosols, and land use for air quality and climate change in CMIP7  5. Similarities to CMIP6 experiments Modification of piClim-2xDMS to include 2xPMOA  6. Forcing differences from parent experiment Doubled primary marine organic carbon aerosol and dimethyl sulphide emissions",
